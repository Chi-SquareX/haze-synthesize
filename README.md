# Synthesize Hazy/Foggy Image using Monodepth and Atmospheric Scattering Model

This project is to synthesize hazy/foggy image using Monodepth and atmospheric scattering model.

### Dependencies
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

### How to Use

#### 1. Generate Depth Map (using Monodepth2)
- An easy-to-use implementation of Monodepth2 can be reached via this [link](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2)

#### 2. Locate Image Files (optional)
- Put the original (clean) image in the folder "docs"
- Put the generated depth map in the folder "docs"
- Say "fname" is the file name of the clean image, the file name of the generated depth map should be "fname_depth"

#### 3. Generate Hazy Image
- Run notebook: synthesize-haze.ipynb

### Results
- 1st row: original images
- 2nd row: synthesized hazy images with sparse haze
- 3rd row: synthesized hazy images with dense haze
